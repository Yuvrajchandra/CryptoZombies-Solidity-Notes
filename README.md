This repository contains codes from CryptoZombies (Solidity Tutorial &amp; Etherium Blockchain Programming Course)

CryptoZombies is a free, open source, interactive code school that teaches you to build games on Ethereum. The course is designed for beginners to Solidity and starts off with the absolute basics.

## Quick Notes from the course:

### Contracts
Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications — all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.
An empty contract named HelloWorld would look like this:
```
contract HelloWorld {

}
```
### Version Pragma
All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use. This is to prevent issues with future compiler versions potentially introducing changes that would break your code.
```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;
````
